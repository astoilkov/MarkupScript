# IDE Integration

OneScript has a problem. HTML, CSS and JavaScript are at one place which makes code messy.
However, brining these technologies together is essential to fixing current problems with developing web applications.
This could be less of a problem if you keep your components small.
However, OneScript wants to bring it to the next level and introduce a guideline for IDE's on how to implement OneScript
to make OneScript even more powerful platform.
Let's take a look.

## File extension

Example: file.one

## Developer Mode

Action: Enters a mode where the editor should hide all styles in OneScript files.

Shortcut: Ctrl/Command + Shift + M

## Designer Mode

Action: Enters a mode where the editor should hide all code logic in OneScript files.

Shortcut: Ctrl/Command + Shift + M

## Conclusion

Developer and Designer modes will allow for perfect separation between designers and developers
while keeping styles and code where they should be.
